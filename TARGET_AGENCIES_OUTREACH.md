**Email Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

I'm reaching out because I built something that might save [Agency Name] 5+ hours per client.

Here's the situation: Most agencies spend 3-5 hours manually researching competitors, creating Porter's Five Forces analyses, and building strategic recommendations for each client.

We built an AI tool that does this in 5 minutes.

It generates:
- Client-ready PDF/PowerPoint reports (with YOUR branding)
- Porter's Five Forces competitive analysis
- Market positioning recommendations
- ROI projections & implementation roadmaps
- Content calendar + social media strategy

[Competitor Agency Name] has been using it for the past 60 days and they've:
- 10x'd their strategic deliverable output
- Upsold 15 existing clients on "quarterly strategic reviews"
- Closed 3 new deals by including competitive analysis in proposals

Want to see a 10-minute demo? I can show you a live analysis of one of your clients.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. Here's a 2-min demo video if you want to check it out first: [link]

### Facebook Group Outreach (Soft Sell)

**Post in Agency Owner Groups:**

```
Hey everyone,

Quick poll: How long does it take your agency to create a competitive analysis report for a new client?

We're launching a tool that automates this (Porter's Five Forces, competitor intel, strategic recs) and trying to figure out if agencies would actually use it.

For context: We can generate a client-ready report in ~5 minutes vs. 3-5 hours manually.

Would this be useful? Or is competitive analysis something you prefer doing by hand?
```

**Follow-Up Comment (After Replies):**

```
Really helpful feedback, thanks everyone!

For those who said "yes" - we're looking for 5-10 beta testers to try it out for free in exchange for feedback.

DM me if interested and I'll send access.
```

## Objection Handling

### "We already do this manually - it's not that hard"

**Response:**
"Totally get it. How long does it take you per client? [Wait for answer] So if you're billing $150/hour and spending 4 hours on this, that's $600 of your time per client. At $99/month for unlimited reports, you'd break even after creating 1 report. Everything after that is pure time savings. Plus your team can now do 10 analyses in the time it used to take to do 1."

### "We use ChatGPT for this"

**Response:**
"Fair enough - do your clients see the raw ChatGPT output? [Usually no] Right - because it's not professional. Our tool generates client-ready PDFs with your branding, structured frameworks (Porter's Five Forces, SWOT, etc.), and properly formatted for delivery. It's the difference between a Google Doc and a $2000 McKinsey report."

### "This is too expensive"

**Response:**
"I hear you. What do you currently charge clients for a competitive analysis report? [Answer] And how many of those do you do per month? [Answer] So if you do 5 reports at $2000 each, that's $10K in monthly revenue from strategic consulting. We're $99/month. That's less than 1% of your revenue from this service. Plus you can now do 50 reports in the time it used to take to do 5, so you can sell more."

### "I don't think my clients will pay for this"

**Response:**
"You might be surprised. We're seeing agencies charge $1500-$3000 for a 'quarterly strategic review' that includes this analysis. But even if you don't sell it as a standalone, you can include it in onboarding packages to close more deals. [Competitor Agency] added it to their proposals and their close rate went from 30% to 50% because prospects saw the data-driven approach."

### "What if the AI gets something wrong?"

**Response:**
"Great question. The output is based on publicly available data + AI synthesis. You should always review it before sending to clients - think of it like a first draft from a junior analyst. Most agencies spend 10 minutes reviewing/editing vs. 4 hours creating from scratch. And the AI is trained on Porter's frameworks and HBS case studies, so the strategic recommendations are solid."

### "We need custom frameworks, not generic analysis"

**Response:**
"Totally understand. What specific frameworks do you use? [Wait for answer] We support Porter's Five Forces, Value Chain, Blue Ocean, SWOT, and HBS frameworks out of the box. If you need something custom, we can add it - we've built custom frameworks for 3 agencies already. What would you need?"

## Bonus: Referral Program

Once you have 5 happy customers, launch a referral program:

**Offer:**
"Refer an agency, get 1 month free (they get $50 off first month)"

**Email to Existing Customers:**

```
Hey [First Name],

Quick favor:

If you know any agency owners who could benefit from [Product Name], send them my way!

For every referral that signs up, you get 1 month free (and they get $50 off their first month).

Just have them mention "[Your Agency Name]" when they sign up.

Thanks!
[Your Name]

P.S. Already referred someone? Let me know and I'll credit your account.
```

This creates a flywheel: Happy customers → Referrals → More customers → More referrals.

---

**Bottom Line:**

You need to talk to 100 agencies to find 10 that will pay. Start with the list above, send 20 messages per day, and focus on demo quality over quantity.

The agencies are out there - you just need to reach them with the right message.
