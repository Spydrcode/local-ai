# Porter-Grade AI Agent Optimization Strategy

## 🎯 Goal
Transform Local AI into a Harvard Business School-caliber strategic analysis platform using fine-tuned models and custom workflows.

## 📊 Current State vs. Target State

### Current (Generic GPT-4)
- ❌ Generic business advice
- ❌ Template-based responses
- ❌ No industry-specific depth
- ❌ Limited Porter framework understanding
- ❌ No case study methodology

### Target (Porter-Grade)
- ✅ Industry-specific strategic analysis
- ✅ Deep Porter framework application
- ✅ HBS case methodology
- ✅ Competitive positioning expertise
- ✅ Data-driven recommendations

## 🔧 Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Fine-Tuned Porter Models (Weeks 1-2)

**1.1 Create Porter Training Dataset**
```
datasets/
  porter-five-forces/
    - 500+ real business analyses
    - Industry-specific examples
    - Correct vs incorrect applications
  
  value-chain/
    - 300+ value chain mappings
    - Cost driver identification
    - Differentiation opportunities
  
  competitive-strategy/
    - 400+ positioning analyses
    - Trade-off decisions
    - Strategic choice frameworks
```

**1.2 Fine-Tune Models**
- Base: `mistral-7b-instruct` or `llama-3-8b`
- Training: Porter-specific examples
- Validation: HBS case studies
- Output: `porter-strategist-v1`

### Phase 2: Custom Agent Workflows (Weeks 3-4)

**2.1 Multi-Stage Analysis Pipeline**
```
Stage 1: Data Gathering → Industry Classification
Stage 2: Competitive Analysis → Five Forces
Stage 3: Internal Analysis → Value Chain
Stage 4: Strategic Synthesis → Recommendations
Stage 5: Validation → Quality Check
```

**2.2 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- Vector DB: Porter's books, HBS cases, industry reports
- Semantic search: Find relevant frameworks
- Context injection: Ground responses in theory

### Phase 3: Specialized Models (Weeks 5-6)

**3.1 Industry-Specific Models**
- `porter-retail-v1` - Retail/e-commerce
- `porter-services-v1` - Professional services
- `porter-manufacturing-v1` - Manufacturing
- `porter-hospitality-v1` - Restaurants/hotels

**3.2 Framework-Specific Models**
- `five-forces-expert` - Deep Five Forces analysis
- `value-chain-optimizer` - Value chain mapping
- `competitive-positioning` - Strategy formulation

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Option A: Ollama + LangChain (Recommended)
**Pros:** Local control, no API costs, fast iteration
**Cons:** Requires GPU, initial setup time

### Option B: Hugging Face + Custom Pipeline
**Pros:** Access to latest models, easy deployment
**Cons:** API costs, less control

### Option C: Hybrid (Best of Both)
**Pros:** Use local for speed, cloud for complex tasks
**Cons:** More complex architecture

## 📈 Quality Metrics

### Porter Framework Accuracy
- Five Forces identification: >90%
- Value chain mapping: >85%
- Strategic recommendations: >80%

### Business Specificity
- Generic advice: <10%
- Industry-specific insights: >70%
- Actionable recommendations: >80%

### HBS Case Methodology
- Problem identification: >90%

- Decision framework: >80%

## 💰 Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Current (GPT-4 API)
- Cost: $0.03/1K tokens (input) + $0.06/1K tokens (output)
- Per analysis: ~$0.50-$2.00
- Monthly (1000 analyses): $500-$2000

### Optimized (Fine-tuned Local)
- Setup: $500-$1000 (one-time)
- Hardware: $1000-$3000 (GPU) or $0 (cloud)
- Per analysis: $0.00-$0.05
- Monthly (1000 analyses): $0-$50

**ROI: 90-95% cost reduction + better quality**

## 🚀 Quick Wins (Implement First)

1. **RAG with Porter's Books** (Week 1)
   - Embed "Competitive Strategy" and "Competitive Advantage"
   - Use for context in all agent responses
   - Immediate quality improvement

2. **Prompt Engineering** (Week 1)
   - Add Porter-specific examples to system prompts
   - Include HBS case methodology
   - Validate against generic responses

3. **Industry Classification** (Week 2)
   - Build industry taxonomy
   - Route to specialized prompts
   - Improve specificity by 50%

4. **Multi-Agent Validation** (Week 2)
   - Agent 1: Generate analysis
   - Agent 2: Critique for Porter accuracy
   - Agent 3: Validate business specificity
   - Iterate until quality threshold met
