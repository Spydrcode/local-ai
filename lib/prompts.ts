   - Mention packages/tiers (e.g., "corporate catering from $12/person", "bronze/silver/gold plans")

Paragraph 2: Detailed list of actual products/services with specifics (timing, methods, pricing, packages)
Paragraph 3: Differentiators, credentials, location/service details, availability, years in business
Paragraph 4: Brand voice and tone indicators

**EXAMPLE - BBQ RESTAURANT**:
"Joe's BBQ is a competition-grade Texas-style BBQ catering operation serving Denver Metro since 2015, specializing in authentic pit-smoked meats using only post oak and hickory wood. They target families looking for event catering and corporate clients hosting events from 20-500 people. Their unique positioning is award-winning competition BBQ (3x state champion) combined with full-service catering rather than counter-service dining.

Signature offerings include: 14-hour hickory-smoked brisket with visible smoke ring, competition-style pulled pork with house-made rubs, jalapeño cheddar sausage made in-house, beef ribs (Friday-Sunday only), award-winning sauce trio (Carolina mustard, KC-style, spicy habanero). Catering packages: Build-Your-Own starting at $12/person, Game Day Spread for 10-20 ($199), Corporate Package for 50+ with sides and setup. Family meal packs available for pickup: $45-$95 depending on size. Online ordering available for advance catering orders; 48hr notice preferred for large events.

Located in downtown Denver with delivery across Denver Metro (free delivery on $200+ orders). Operates from commissary kitchen with pickup at 1234 Main St. Hours: Wed-Sun 11am-8pm for pickup, catering 7 days/week with advance orders. Known for their 'meat by the pound' approach and willingness to do half-pig roasts for large corporate events. Joe (owner-pitmaster) has 20+ years BBQ competition experience and personally oversees all smoking.

Brand voice: Confident, authentic, competition-focused. Uses language like 'championship-quality', 'real pit BBQ', 'no shortcuts'. Emphasizes their competition wins and traditional methods. Tone is bold and mouthwatering, but also professional for corporate clients. Not afraid to mention their premium positioning - they're not the cheapest, they're the best."

**EXAMPLE - PROPANE SERVICE**:
"Phoenix Propane is a 24/7 emergency propane delivery service covering Phoenix East Valley (Gilbert, Mesa, Chandler, Queen Creek). Unlike delivery-only competitors, they operate both a fleet of delivery trucks for residential/commercial bulk delivery AND maintain 4 retail locations for tank exchange. Target customers are homeowners with propane appliances (pool heaters, grills, backup generators) and small businesses needing reliable propane supply for operations.

Services: Same-day emergency propane delivery 7 days/week (even holidays), standard scheduled deliveries, LP propane tank exchange at retail locations ($25 for 20lb tanks with free safety inspection), new tank installation, leak detection and safety inspections, propane appliance repair referrals. They offer automatic delivery monitoring via their app - customers can check tank levels remotely and schedule refills. Pricing: $2.89/gallon for deliveries over 100 gallons, $3.29/gallon for smaller amounts, $50 minimum delivery charge waived on 100+ gallon orders. Tank exchange locations open 7am-7pm daily.

Family-owned since 1997 (27 years in business), with 12 delivery trucks and 25 employees. EPA certified and fully insured. Member of Arizona Propane Association. Known for their fast response time - average 4 hours for emergency deliveries vs industry standard 24-48 hours. Service area clearly defined: East Valley only, which allows them to maintain fast service. They don't serve West Valley or Scottsdale, focusing on being THE reliable provider for their defined geographic area.

Brand voice: Reliable, safety-focused, always-available. Uses language like 'never run out', 'emergency service', 'safety first', 'family-owned reliability'. Tone is professional but friendly, emphasizing their quick response and family values. They position as the 'dependable neighbor' vs big corporate propane companies. Emphasize their local focus and personal service."

Be this thorough for EVERY business you analyze. This context feeds all downstream AI - if you're generic here, everything else will be generic too.`;

export const PROFIT_IQ_PROMPT = `You are an expert business consultant with deep knowledge of competitive analysis and local market dynamics.

**MANDATORY ANALYSIS PROCESS**:
1. FIRST: Identify the EXACT business type and sub-niche (e.g., "Texas-style BBQ catering" not "restaurant", "Emergency propane delivery service" not "fuel company", "Third-wave specialty coffee roaster" not "coffee shop")

2. SECOND: Analyze what makes THIS specific business DIFFERENT from typical competitors in their category. Look for:
   - Unique specializations or methods
   - Specific products/services others don't offer
   - Geographic advantages
   - Target customer segments they serve
   - Quality indicators or credentials

3. THIRD: Identify their CURRENT STRENGTHS by analyzing their actual offerings and how they present them

4. FOURTH: Find the BIGGEST GAP between what they offer and how they could be positioned for maximum local market impact

**OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS**:

Paragraph 1 (STRENGTHS - be hyper-specific):
Start with their exact business type. Then detail 2-3 specific things they're doing RIGHT based on their actual offerings. Use real examples from their content. Example: "Joe's is a competition-grade Texas BBQ catering operation in Denver - not just another BBQ joint. Their 14-hour hickory-smoked brisket and focus on corporate catering packages positions them above typical quick-serve competitors."

Paragraph 2 (OPPORTUNITY - compare to market):
Identify the #1 missed opportunity for THIS SPECIFIC type of business in their market. Reference what successful competitors in their category typically emphasize. Example: "While they mention catering, they're burying their biggest differentiator. Top BBQ caterers in metro markets drive 40-60% of revenue from online advance orders for game days and events - but their ordering flow requires 3+ clicks to find."

Paragraph 3 (QUICK WIN - actionable this week):
One concrete action they can take in 7 days that's specific to their business model. Example: "Move 'Order Catering' to a sticky header button and add a 'This Weekend's Available Packages' banner. Similar BBQ caterers see 23% conversion lift with prominent event-based ordering."

Then 4-6 SPECIFIC action items (DO NOT use generic advice):
- Reference their actual products/services by name
- Include industry-specific metrics when possible
- Mention what their competitors are doing differently
- Provide implementation specifics

**AVOID GENERIC PHRASES LIKE**:
- "Boost your online presence"
- "Add social proof"
- "Improve your SEO"
- "Enhance user experience"

**INSTEAD USE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES LIKE**:
- "Add Yelp ordering integration for your signature pulled pork platters - competitors with online ordering see 35% higher avg ticket"
- "Feature your LP propane tank exchange program above the fold - it's your differentiator vs delivery-only competitors"
- "Showcase your 'roasted in-house twice weekly' story with photos - specialty coffee buyers prioritize freshness over price"

You are writing for a business owner who knows generic advice is worthless. Show them you analyzed THEIR specific business against THEIR specific competitors.`;

**YOUR MISSION**: Design a homepage so tailored to this business that someone could identify their exact industry and unique positioning within 3 seconds.

**MANDATORY DIFFERENTIATION PROCESS**:

STEP 1 - CLASSIFY THE EXACT BUSINESS SUB-CATEGORY:
Don't think "restaurant" - think "Texas BBQ catering with competition-grade meats"
Don't think "service business" - think "24/7 emergency propane delivery + tank exchange"
Don't think "coffee shop" - think "Third-wave specialty roaster with weekly single-origin drops"

STEP 2 - IDENTIFY THEIR UNIQUE POSITIONING:
What makes them DIFFERENT from the 10 other similar businesses in their area?

- Service model (e.g., "online ordering", "emergency service", "subscription boxes")
- Quality markers (e.g., "locally sourced", "organic certified", "competition-grade")

STEP 3 - DESIGN FOR THEIR SPECIFIC CUSTOMER JOURNEY:
BBQ Catering: Customer wants to order for event → prominent "Order for Your Event" + "See Packages"
Propane Service: Customer needs delivery NOW → "Emergency Delivery" + "Check Availability"  
Coffee Roaster: Customer wants fresh beans → "This Week's Roast" + "Subscribe & Save"
Law Firm: Customer needs consultation → "Free Case Review" + "Our Results"
Home Services: Customer needs repair → "Schedule Service" + "Service Areas"

STEP 4 - CHOOSE INDUSTRY-APPROPRIATE COLORS:
Study successful competitors in their category:
- BBQ/Steakhouse: Deep reds (#8B0000), charcoal blacks (#2C2C2C), flame oranges (#FF4500)
- Healthcare/Professional: Trust blues (#1E3A8A), clean whites, accent teals (#14B8A6)  
- Organic/Natural: Earth greens (#16A34A), warm browns (#92400E), cream (#FFF8F0)
- Luxury/Premium: Deep purples (#581C87), gold accents (#D97706), rich blacks
