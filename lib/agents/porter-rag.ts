**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS**:
1. Apply the Porter frameworks above to THIS SPECIFIC BUSINESS
2. Reference the framework concepts explicitly in your analysis
3. Avoid generic advice - ground every insight in Porter's theory
4. Identify trade-offs and strategic choices (Porter's core principle)
5. Explain WHY your recommendations align with competitive advantage theory`
