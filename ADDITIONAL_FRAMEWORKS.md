// 2. Fetch demo data
// 3. Check agency report limits
// 4. Generate analysis using AI with structured prompt
// 5. Parse JSON response
// 6. Log activity and increment usage
// 7. Return structured data
```

**Common response format:**

```typescript
{
  success: true,
  data: {
    summary: "Executive summary of analysis",
    sections: {
      // Framework-specific sections
    },
    recommendations: ["Prioritized action items"],
    nextSteps: ["What to do next"],
