## Problem Section

### Headline
```
The Strategic Analysis Bottleneck
```

### Body Copy
```
Your agency knows competitive analysis drives client results. But creating professional
deliverables takes time your team doesn't have:

❌ 3-5 hours per client on manual competitor research
❌ Another 2 hours formatting into client-ready reports
❌ Inconsistent quality across different team members
❌ Can't scale without hiring expensive analysts

Meanwhile, your competitors are closing deals with data-driven proposals
while you're stuck in Google Docs.

### Headline

How Agencies Use [Product Name]
```

### Use Case 1: New Client Onboarding
```
🎯 The Problem
Every new client needs a competitive analysis. Your team spends 5 hours researching competitors,
analyzing market positioning, and creating a strategy document.

✅ The Solution
Run [Product Name] analysis during the kickoff call. Export branded PDF and walk client through
findings in real-time. Close more deals by demonstrating expertise immediately.

💰 Impact
- Saved 5 hours per client (100+ hours/year for 20 clients)
- Closed 3 additional deals by including analysis in proposals
- Added $18,000 in annual revenue
```

### Use Case 2: Upselling Existing Clients
```
🎯 The Problem
Your retainer clients are stable, but you're leaving money on the table. They'd pay more for
strategic consulting, but you don't have capacity to create custom analysis.

✅ The Solution
Offer "Quarterly Strategic Review" as an add-on ($1,500-$3,000). Run [Product Name] analysis,
customize with your insights, present findings in a client review meeting.

💰 Impact
- Upsold 15 existing clients on strategic reviews
- Added $30,000 in annual recurring revenue
- Increased average client value by 25%
```

### Use Case 3: Differentiation in Proposals
```
🎯 The Problem
You're competing against 3 other agencies for a $50K contract. Your proposal looks the same as everyone else's.

✅ The Solution
Include free competitive analysis in proposal. Show prospect their market position, competitor weaknesses,
and growth opportunities. Demonstrate expertise before they even hire you.

💰 Impact
- Increased proposal close rate from 30% to 50%
- Won $150K in contracts by including strategic analysis
- Differentiated from commoditized "SEO + social media" agencies
```

## FAQ Section

### Headline
```
Frequently Asked Questions
```

### FAQ Items

**Q: How is this different from ChatGPT?**
```
A: ChatGPT generates raw text. [Product Name] creates professional, client-ready deliverables
with your branding, structured frameworks (Porter's Five Forces, etc.), and formatted for immediate
delivery. Think: the difference between a Google Doc and a $2,000 McKinsey report.
```

**Q: What if the AI gets something wrong?**
```
A: The AI provides a first draft based on publicly available data and strategic frameworks.
You should review and customize before sending to clients (takes ~10 minutes vs. 5 hours to create
from scratch). Think of it as a smart junior analyst, not a replacement for your expertise.
```

**Q: Can I customize the reports?**
```
A: Yes! You can edit all content before exporting. You can also add your own insights, adjust
recommendations, and include proprietary frameworks. The AI provides the foundation; you add your expertise.
```

**Q: What industries does this work for?**
```
A: Any B2C or B2B business with a website. We've generated reports for restaurants, law firms,
SaaS companies, healthcare providers, e-commerce stores, and more. The AI adapts analysis to the
specific industry and competitive landscape.
```

**Q: Do you offer training or onboarding?**
```
A: Yes! All plans include:
- 30-minute onboarding call
- Video tutorials
- Email/chat support
- Agency Starter and Pro plans include dedicated account manager
```

**Q: What if I need more than the monthly analysis limit?**
```
A: You can upgrade plans anytime or purchase add-on analysis packs ($5 per additional report).
Most agencies upgrade to Agency Pro (unlimited) once they start upselling strategic consulting to clients.
```

**Q: Can I white-label this and resell it?**
```
A: Enterprise plans include reseller rights. You can offer [Product Name] to your clients under
your own branding. Contact us for pricing.
```

**Q: What's your refund policy?**
```
A: 30-day money-back guarantee, no questions asked. If [Product Name] doesn't save you time and
help you close more deals, we'll refund your first month.
