## **What's Next?**

To fully activate all these new capabilities:

### **1. Seed the Vector Knowledge Base**
```bash
npm run seed-marketing-knowledge
```

This will populate Pinecone with 40+ marketing framework entries for RAG-powered recommendations.

The orchestrator should integrate HBS frameworks for richer analysis. Consider adding:
- Jobs-to-be-Done analysis to "full-marketing-strategy"
- Consumer Journey mapping to all workflows

### **3. Test the New Agents**
```bash
# Test individual agents via API
POST /api/marketing-strategy
{
  "website": "https://example.com",
  "workflow": "full-marketing-strategy"
}
```

### **4. Monitor & Iterate**
- Track which frameworks provide most value
- Gather user feedback on recommendations
- Continuously improve prompts based on results
